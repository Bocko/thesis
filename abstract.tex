\chapter{Abstract}

In the past decades, the microelectronic industry has been following the Moore's law to improve the performance of integrated circuits (IC). However, it will probably be impossible to follow this law in the future due to physical limitations appearing with the miniaturization of the transistors below a certain threshold. In order to overcome this problem, new technologies have emerged, and among them the 3D-Stacked Integrated Circuits (3D-SIC) have been proposed to keep the Moore's momentum alive. 3D-SICs can bring numerous advantages in the design of future ICs but at the cost of additional design complexity due to their highly combinatorial nature, and the optimization of several conflicting criteria. In this paper, we present a first study of tools that can help the design of 3D-SICs, using mutiobjective optimization (MOO). Our study has targeted one of the main issues in the design of 3D-SICs: the floorplanning. This thesis shows that the use of a multi-criteria paradigm can provide relevant and objective analysis of the problem that may not be feasible with the current design methods. This can allow a quick design space exploration and an improvement of the current design flows. Also, with its flexibility, MOO can cope with the multiple degrees of freedom of 3D-SICs, which enables more design possibilities.
