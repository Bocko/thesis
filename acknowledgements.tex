\chapter{Acknowledgements}

This thesis would have been impossible without the mentoring of my supervisors Yves De Smet, Dragomir Milojevic and Frédéric Robert. Thank you all for your support and advices.

I would also like to thank Prof. Pierre Mathys for his involvement in my \textit{comité d'accompagnement} and all the very interesting discussion we had around my thesis.

A special thanks to my colleagues and friends at the ULB: François, Michaël, 

My deepest gratitude goes to my family who helped me achieve this thesis with their unconditional love and support.
