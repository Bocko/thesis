\chapter{Acknowledgements}

This thesis would not have been possible without the mentoring of my supervisors Yves De Smet, Dragomir Milojevic and Frédéric Robert. Thank you for your support and advices.

I would also like to thank Pierre Mathys for his involvement in my \textit{comité d'ac-compagnement} and all the very interesting discussions regarding my thesis.

I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with Xavier Gandibleux in Nantes and Bertrand Granado and Andrea Pinna for welcoming me into their lab in Paris.

It was very rewarding and enjoyable to work with and discuss my ideas with my colleagues and friends at the ULB: Michaël, François, Renaud, Karim, Matthieu, Oli, Antoun, Axel, Thierry, the Yannicks. Thank you for the stimulating environment you created.

Where would I be without my friends: Roxane, Lauriane, Morgane, Cédric, Céline, Pierre-Olivier, Niall, Juliette, Benjamin, Nathalie, Guillaume, Momo, Antoine, Loïc and many others that I will inevitably forget. Thank you all for having crossed my path, cheering me up when I needed it and the friendship you honour me with.

My deepest gratitude goes to my family who helped me succeed in my studies and this thesis, with their unconditional love and support.

Finally, a special thank to Lucie for lighting up my life with this universe we share with each other.
