\chapter{Acknowledgements}

This thesis would have been impossible without the mentoring of my supervisors Yves De Smet, Dragomir Milojevic and Frédéric Robert. Thank you for your support and advices.

I would also like to thank Pierre Mathys for his involvement in my \textit{comité d'ac-compagnement} and all the very interesting discussions we had around my thesis.

I am also grateful to Xavier Gandibleux for the collaboration I had with him in Nantes and Bertrand Granado and Andrea Pinna for welcoming me in their lab in Paris.

It was also great fun to work and discuss with my colleagues and friends at the ULB: Michaël, François, Renaud, Karim, Matthieu, Oli, Antoun, Axel, the Yannicks. Thank you for the stimulating environment you created.

What would it be without my friends: Roxane, Lauriane, Cédric, Céline, Pierre-Olivier, Niall, Nathalie, Benjamin, Guillaume and many others that I will inevitably forget. Thank you all for crossing my path, cheering me up when I needed it and the friendship you honour me with.

My deepest gratitude goes to my family who helped me succeed in my studies and this thesis, with their unconditional love and support.

Finally, a special thank to Lucie for lighting up my life with this universe we share with each other.
