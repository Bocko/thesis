\section{Introduction}
In the introduction, we have quickly presented to state of the field of microelectronics design where the industry will be facing physical limitations of the silicon. In order to overcome this problem, 3D-stacked integrated circuits have been proposed and by the industrial and academic communities. In this chapter we will present a short overview of this technology: show how 3D-SICs can be manufactured, their advantages and drawbacks, the challenges when designing them. We will then discuss about the limitations of current design flows and why they should be improved in order to address the complexity of designing 3D-SICs.
%\section{2D architecture and its limitations}
%
%In order to continuously improve the performance of integrated circuits (IC), technologists deploy enormous efforts to produce IC manufacturing process that is compelling to follow the well-known Moore's Law (see Figure \ref{fig:mooreslaw}). This empirical law predicts a doubling of the transistors' integration each 18 months and therefore increasing logic capacity of the circuit per unit area.

%
%The improvements of 2D architectures are primarily driven by the reduction of the transistor size. By reducing transistor dimensions, the switching speed is increased thanks to the shorter distance between the source and the drain, implying an improvement of the overall speed of the designs.
%
%However, as the transistor size is decreasing, the observed improvement is also getting smaller. Indeed, a smaller transistor allows higher device density but will slightly decrease the dynamic and increase the total delay (sum of gate and interconnection delays) at the level of the complete circuit. Also, power consumption is increased due to higher leakage and increasing interconnection wire length \cite{5227192}. In Figure \ref{fig:delaygateinterconnect} is shown the trends in transistor gate delay and interconnect delay with IC fabrication technology where the crossover point represents the interconnect bottleneck \cite{kirchain2007}.

%\label{fig:delaygateinterconnect}
%\end{figure}
%
%With the miniaturization, quantum effects such as quantum tunnelling will significantly affect how a transistor behave \cite{1240081}.
%
%In addition to these physical aspects, economical considerations that will hinder the IC evolution beyond 20nm have to be taken into account \cite{5227192,PFF10}.
%
%In order to overcome these limitations, new technologies have been proposed such as the carbon nanotubes \cite{tans1998room}, the nanowire transistors \cite{doi:10.1021/nl025875l}, the single-electron transistors \cite{citeulike:4194929}, but also the 3D-Stacked Integrated Circuits (3D-SIC) proposed by the academic and industrial communities. The latter has been often cited as the most prominent one~\cite{659500}.

\section{3D integration}

Most of the current ICs are designed with electronic components (i.e. transistors) that are planar (although multi-gate transistors, such as finFETs tends to extend in the 3rd dimension) interconnected using up to a maximum of 12 (also planar) wiring (metal) layers per circuit. Those conventional ICs can thus be considered to be two-dimensional (2D)-ICs since both device and interconnect are predominantly made in a planar way \cite{1393404,fujitsu08}. As a major evolution of 2D-ICs, 3D-SICs are designed with multiple traditional 2D-ICs (that are manufactured independently, using standard CMOS technology) that are assembled (stacked) vertically in 3D-tiers. In face to back configuration, different 2D circuits communicate between tiers using vertical interconnections that need to connect front side of the chip and the backside, i.e. they need to traverse bulk silicon. In face to face configuration, the chip communicate with their respective front sides. These connections can be Through Silicon Vias (TSV) and if it is in a face to face configuration, micro bumps (µBump) or copper pads (CuPad) can also be used. These binding technologies can be today manufactured with satisfactory geometrical properties, namely their diameter, pitch and height, allowing efficient integration of real-world systems~\cite{1705326,5746413}. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:3D_SIC_SOC2010}, where 2 dies, oriented face down are connected (Figure \ref{fig:backtoface}). An active component (i.e. logic gate) of the T1 is connected to the T2 using a TSV, back side metallization layer (to enable TSV placement anywhere in the T1 die), and µbump on the top layer of the T2, that is then connected, through a series of metal layers of the T2, to the active component of the top tier (T2). The corresponding face to face configuration is shown in Figure \ref{fig:facetoface}.

\end{figure}

%The benefits of using 3D-ICs are numerous and have been already pointed out in the literature very often over the past few years \cite{659500}. These advantages will be summarized in the next subsections.
%First, by adding vertical dimension to the construction of the physical IC we can increase the IC packaging density. This means more gates for the same circuit footprint, that is much higher functional complexity of the final circuit for the same packaging volume. Secondly, the 3D-SICs are expected to have much better computing/power dissipation ratio. The integration in the 3rd dimension allows the design of circuits with different parts being closer to each other, resulting in less and shorter wires \cite{981091}. Lowering wire delays and allowing higher operating frequencies will result in increased bandwidths between nodes satisfying data hungry applications. Also, less and shorter wires mean lower total parasitic capacitance and inductance of the circuit, resulting in lower power dissipation. Finally, the 3D-SICs will enable the design of really heterogeneous systems, embedding not only traditional digital circuits such as processors and memories, but also analogue circuits such as sensors, antennas and power supplies \cite{4299568}.

%Currently different technologies for fabrication of 3D-SICs have been proposed in the literature. Proposed methods have been used for implementation of complete systems going far beyond simple proof-of-concept or feasibility demonstrators. One can mention the implementation of a processor and memory in a single 3D chip dedicated for video coding applications \cite{1696226} and a processor with multiple levels of memory hierarchy dedicated for high-throughput server applications \cite{1168873}. Finally, the first commercial 3D-SIC products have been already announced by IBM \cite{1167715} and companies specialized in 3D semiconductor industry such as Tezzaron \cite{terra04}.

%3D Integration is taken into account in the roadmaps of almost all key players in the field of integrated circuit design and manufacturing.

\subsection{Manufacturing technologies}

Several 3D manufacturing technologies have been proposed and have been used to implement complete systems. Among the existing possibilities, four major categories of methods that illustrate 3D integration can be cited \cite{659500,1652906}.

\paragraph{Transistor stacking}

The transistor stacking consists in creating several transistors level on one substrate. This should be the better way to manufacture 3D circuits although the success rate are currently limited due to thermal issues among the different limitations. The required temperatures to create a layer of high-performance transistors would provoke the destruction of the copper and aluminium already laid down on the previous layer \cite{659500}.

\paragraph{Chip stacking}

This methods consists in stacking components that have been designed and tested separately to produce a system-in-package (SiP). The vertically-stacked chips are interconnected with traditional wirings (lateral wire bondings). The principal advantage of this method is an improvement in terms of size. The wirings are shorter however the components integration density is not increased compared to a 2D system \cite{659500}.

\paragraph{Die-on-wafer stacking}

In this method, known good dies (KGD), which are functional tested chips, are connected to a host wafer containing other KGDs. These KGDs can be interconnected with organic glues, oxide or metal bonding. The wafer and the bonded KGDs are then shaped to create the interconnections. Different substrates can be combined if the required temperature is low enough to minimize non-homogeneous expansion effects \cite{659500}.

The die-on-wafer stacking can use interconnections on the edges of the chips or through-die. Depending on the interconnection type, this method can produce a better integration level than the chip stacking, with a better cost per connection ratio and a higher interconnection density, while holding the advantages of the KGDs.

The quality of the stacking depends on the pick-and-place equipment which is used to position the dies on the wafer. The placement accuracy will determine the possible interconnection density. Also, current equipments are supposed to handle fully buffered chips, not naked circuits so it does not provide protection to static discharge \cite{659500}. 

\paragraph{Wafer-level stacking}

This methods consists in bonding entire wafers into a stack. The vertical through-wafer connections are made directly trough each substrate to the next wafer and it transistors layer. Similarly to the previous method, the interconnection density rely on the precision of the alignment, which is however currently better than the die-on-wafer stacking. This greater accuracy implies a better cost per connection ratio and a higher interconnection density compared to the die-on-wafer stacking \cite{659500}.

The use of mixed substrates is also possible, only limited by the process temperatures. All the processing is done at the wafer level so wafer handling equipments are used. Since these provide protection to static discharge so there is no need to include buffering between the layers. The methods to bind two wafers are the same that are available for the die-on-wafer method.

One drawback to wafer-level stacking is its efficiency, since the chips on a wafer are not all KGDs.

\subsection{3D-SIC advantages}

\paragraph{Interconnection length}

The 3D integration allows to design circuits with components closer to each other. Wire of a few millimetres long can be replaced by TSV of a few tens of microns, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:wire}. These shorter interconnections will introduce shorter delays, hence allowing higher working frequencies \cite{659500,981091}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{wire.eps}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\caption{Shorter interconnections \cite{659500}}
\label{fig:wire}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Silicon efficiency and accessibility}

Adding a vertical dimension allows to increase the integration density. It is therefore possible to have more logic gates than a 2D-IC for the same footprint, hence a more efficient use of the silicon as shown in Figure \ref{fig:footprint}. For instance, compared to the footprint of a 2D-IC, the 3D-SICs can double the integration for a 50\% use of a 2D footprint \cite{659500}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{footprint.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\caption{Silicon efficiency \cite{659500}}
\label{fig:footprint}
\end{figure}

In addition, the 3D integration allows a better accessibility for the components, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:accessibility}. Indeed, for a 2D structure, 8 accessible neighbours can be considered for a central element (Figure \ref{fig:accessibility}a), whereas for a 3D structure, the number of accessible neighbours can reach 116 with through-tiers interconnections (Figure \ref{fig:accessibility}b) \cite{659500}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{accessibility.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\caption{Components accessibility \cite{659500}}
\label{fig:accessibility}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Bandwidth}

The use of TSVs on 3D-SIC can significantly increase the bandwidth of a circuit. Indeed, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bandwidth}, the interconnections are not only limited to peripheral connections but can also make use of the circuit's surface. At a same working frequencies, this allows more bandwidth while at lower frequencies, the same bandwidth usage will require less power.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{bandwidth.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\caption{Bandwidth improvement \cite{659500}}
\label{fig:bandwidth}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Consumption and noise}

Shorter interconnections generally translates into lower capacitance and inductance parasitics. This means a decrease of the numbers of repeaters, hence a better consumption, less noise and less jittern hence lower delays and power consumption.

\paragraph{Heterogeneous circuits}

The 3D technologies allow truly heterogeneous designs. For instance, it is possible to integrate, in addition to traditional digital circuits of different technologies, analogical circuits such as sensors or antennas, as well as power supply, which give 3D-SIC a high degree diversity. It is also possible to mix old and new generations technologies to lower the cost of future circuits.\cite{4299568}.
%The Fig. \ref{fig:heterogeneity} shows a schematic view of a 3D-SIC developed by IMEC for biomedical purposes that contains antennas, DSPs, EEG/ECG sensors, a power supply and solar cells \cite{4198870}.

\subsection{3D-SIC design challenges}

As explained, 3D-SICs offer numerous design perspectives thanks to their advantages. However there are drawbacks that need to be taken into account and that will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

\paragraph{Thermal dissipation}
The power density has increased exponentially over the past decades for the 2D-ICs and it appears that this trend will continue in the near future. As for 3D-SICs, due to their higher component density, they will also be subject to higher power density so thermal management should be considered carefully \cite{659500}. A simplified model of thermal dissipation has been developed in this thesis and will presented in Chapter \ref{cha:model}.

\paragraph{Cost}
With the appearance of a new technology, the involvement of a high cost should often be expected. In the case of 3D technology, in addition of the cost of the technology itself, there are the lack of infrastructure and the reluctance of manufacturers who do not want to risk to change to new technologies \cite{659500}.

\paragraph{Design complexity and design software}
A large number of systems have been implemented using the 2D technologies which means that current tools can cope with 2D design complexity even if they show more and more their limits \cite{vanderbiest06, PFF10}. As for 3D-SICs, the increased complexity can be tackled by developing adapted software \cite{659500}. However, to the best of our knowledge, few 3D dedicated software currently exist. One can nevertheless cite the works in \cite{1112292,1594713,Xie:2006:DSE:1148015.1148016,4735042}. Most of other tools are mainly developed for and owned by particular manufacturers. In addition, they are based on 2D design tools which does not allow to tackle the complexity of 3D designs integrally as they do not take all 3D specificities into account. For example, as it will be shown in Section \ref{sec:currentflows}, 3D partitioning and floorplanning are considered separately (as it is done for 2D-ICs) whereas the 3D geometrical assignment should be taken as a whole.

In the following section, we will have an overview about these software tools and generally about the design flow used to design integrated circuits.

%\section{2.5D-ICs by Xilinx}
%Now that the 3D integration has been introduced, let us give some notes that are worth mentioning about the 2.5D-ICs introduced by Xilinx \cite{bolsens2011}. 2.5D integration can be considered as a stepping stone to 3D design, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:2d5xilinx}. This technology is based on a silicon interposer where are placed the dies. The bindings required to connect the dies are located on this silicon interposer, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:siliconinterposer}. Compared to classical 2D-ICs, this allow higher interconnect density while being less challenging than 3D-SICs in terms of design flow, thermal issues, reliability, testing and cost as the technology is already existing.

%\label{fig:siliconinterposer}
%\end{figure}
%
%In the following section, we will have an overview about these software tools and generally about the design flows used to design integrated circuits.

\section{Current design flows and their limitations}
\label{sec:currentflows}

Design flows are the combination of electronic design automation (EDA) tools used to produce an integrated circuit. These flows can generally be summarized in 4 main steps \cite{coursefred}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:designflow}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{designflow2.eps}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\caption{Classical design flow}
\label{fig:designflow}
\end{figure}

As one can observe, the design flows are sequential. The process goes from one step to the other with local optimization loops. In practice, it is not unusual to have several rollbacks to the previous steps due to the need of manual intervention to adjust the constraints and reach good solutions. %For instance, the optimization done in the logical design step might work in simulations but can be impractical for the physical design step so a rollback is needed in order to correct this inconsistency.

As explained previously, designing ICs implies numerous choices. At the moment, with this growing complexity, the current design flows can already show their limits. Indeed, these tools are developed to only take into account particular specificities of a circuit (area, timing) whereas other characteristics also have to be optimized. Besides, most of the time, the designers will be likely to freeze a certain amount of choices on basis of their experience, and then begin the optimization process with the remaining parameters. This will therefore limit the exploration of the design space and other good solutions may be ignored. In addition, the fixed choices can be questionable since they are based on the designer's experience and it is difficult to master the whole complexity of the problem in terms of criteria and possibilities of design.

The current design flows, which already showed their limits with conventional 2D-ICs, may thus need improvements to be able to deal with the increased complexity of emerging 3D-SICs \cite{vanderbiest06, PFF10}.

For the moment, most 3D design flows adapt classical flows to include 3D specificities, in particular 3D partitioning and 3D place \& route (see Figure \ref{fig:designflow}). We can observe that these two steps are separated: the circuits are first (manually) partitioned, then the place \& route occurs for each layer. However, one can guess that the performances of a 3D-SIC will depend on the position of a component, considering simultaneously its position on a layer ((X,Y)-coordinates) and the layer where it lies (Z-coordinate). 3D design flows therefore need improvements to take into account these three coordinates at the same time.

\section{Design space exploration tools}

In order to cope with the increasing complexity of integrated circuits and the limitations of the current design flows, numerous tools have been proposed, in particular works about design space exploration (DSE) that have been developed to quickly suggest possible interesting solutions to a designer and speed up the design processes. In this section, we will describe different DSE tools that have been proposed in the literature.

\subsection{2D-IC tools}

\paragraph{MILAN}

The MILAN (Model based Integrated simuLAtioN) framework \cite{Mohanty02rapidsystem-level} aims to simplify the optimization and the exploration of design spaces for System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms. This tool works on the component level and allows the users to choose a compromise between the simulation speed and the results accuracy. The exploration and optimization process is done in two phases: first it searches for possible combinations between the architecture, the application and the mapping and second it estimates the performances (power, latency) depending the precision asked by the users.

\paragraph{SoC Architecture Explorer}

SoC Architecture Explorer \cite{ueda05architecture} is a multi-objective optimization and exploration tool that aims the design of SoC architectures by evaluating the compromises between the footprint and the execution time. The exploration process focuses on the application and the system architecture where the tool analyses the data flow and estimates the data transfers to determine a number of possible architectures.

%http://www.esteco.com/index.jsp
\paragraph{modeFRONTIER (ESTECO)}

modeFRONTIER \cite{esteco01} is a proprietary development environment developed by ESTECO. It is a multi-objective optimization tool that aims parallel SoC architectures. modeFRONTIER allows to deal with up to one million different design configurations thanks to statistical analysis tools and data mining techniques.

%http://www.multicube.eu/
\paragraph{MULTICUBE}

The MULTICUBE project (MULTI$^{3}$) \cite{multicube08, Silvanoetal09} is a European project started in 2008 and dedicated to the multi-objective exploration of MPSoC architectures for multimedia embedded systems. The aims is to developed a framework that allows a quick and automated exploration of the design space to improve the performances of a MPSoC with metrics such as power, latency, computing performance, bandwidth, QoS, etc. This project is based on several heuristics and optimization algorithms that reduce the exploration time and allow a quick selection of the best solutions. In addition, MULTICUBE also aims to define an application-oriented framework based on the results of the multi-objective exploration to optimize the resources allocation and the tasks scheduling of the applications. The exploration is done at the system level, using the SystemC language. The project includes proprietary and open-source tools whose development targets the industry. Among the developed prototyping tools, Multicube explorer and Multicube-SCoPE can be cited.

%http://home.dei.polimi.it/zaccaria/multicube_explorer_v1/Home.html
\subparagraph{Multicube Explorer}

Multicube Explorer \cite{m3explorer09} is a design space exploration framework for supporting platform-based design. This tool allows a fast optimization of a system with objective functions such as power, delays, surface, etc. by means of a system simulator. Multicube explorer proposes several multi-objective optimization methods that aim to propose the best compromises.

%http://www.teisa.unican.es/gim/en/scope/multicube.html
\subparagraph{Multicube-SCoPE}

Multicube-SCoPE \cite{m3scope09} is an evolution of the SCoPE tool \cite{scope04} oriented to design space exploration. It is a fast system performance and power simulator providing metrics associated with a system in order to drive the DSE process.

\subsection{3D-SIC tools}

\paragraph{DSE for 3D-stacked DRAMs by Weis \textit{et al.}}
Design space exploration for 3D-stacked DRAMs has been developed by Weis \textit{et al.} \cite{5763068}. They defined a 3D-DRAM based on a SystemC model with a 3D channel controller and also considered a wiring model for the TSVs. The used metrics are area, performance and energy efficiency evaluated for different DRAM architectures and technologies. 3D thermal issues has been kept out of the scope of the study. The simulation results allowed them to have a trade-off analysis of horizontal wirings against vertical wirings in terms of energy and cell efficiency. They could show quantitatively how a 3D-DRAM can perform better than a classical DRAM.

\subparagraph{Observation}
This work is really interesting as it shows the stakes of using the 3D technology for DRAM. However, since it is based on DRAMs, the tools work with a memory structure that is repeated in the 3D-DRAM, which does not take into consideration more heterogeneous architectures. Also, only trade-off analyses are performed, which does not give a more global multi-criteria insight of the results as it will be illustrated in Chapter \ref{cha:rol.mcda}.

\paragraph{DSE for 3D architecture and DSE for 3D integrated circuits by Xie \textit{et al.}}
Design space exploration for 3D architecture and design space exploration for 3D integrated circuits are two works proposed by Xie \textit{et al.} \cite{Xie:2006:DSE:1148015.1148016,4735042}. In the first study, they combine several tools to perform a DSE:
\begin{itemize}
\item for the 3D cache partitioning, two strategies have been proposed at the subarrays granularity level
\item the area, the delay and the energy of a 3D cache are assessed following a cost function
\item 3DCacti, a tool developed to explore various 3D partitioning options of caches
\item thermal-aware 3D floorplanning based on simulated annealing
\end{itemize}
With the DSE, they are able to propose different possible architectures for 3D microprocessor design by performing trade-off analyses of the criteria.
The second study is an extension where a cost analysis is added.
 
\subparagraph{Observation}
These works seem to be among the most integrated study in the literature with cache partitioning and microprocessor floorplanning, and considering several criteria including thermal issues. However, the partitioning and the floorplanning are separated while a more 3D approach should consider both dimensions simultaneously. Also, the criteria are aggregated with a cost function which can lead to inconsistency as it will be explained in Chapter \ref{cha:rol.mcda} and only trade-off analyses are performed.

\paragraph{Automated design flow for 3D microarchitecture evaluation by Cong \textit{et al.}}
An automated design flow for 3D microarchitecture evaluation has been proposed by Cong \textit{et al.} \cite{1594713}. They propose an evaluation flow for performance assessment and thermal management. This allows them to perform thermal-aware 3D floorplanning.

\subparagraph{Observation}
This work is worth mentioning as it proposes a quick way to evaluate temperature issues. However, it only deals with the thermal criterion.

\paragraph{PathFinding flow}
The PathFinding flow is a project proposed by IMEC and Atrenta \cite{5335663,DBLP:conf/3dic/MilojevicCCRRSAPM09} to deal with design exploration of advanced packaging integration. The aim of this work is to be able to produce a specification for the architecture and for the technology with assessment of performance, power and cost. The methodology is divided in 3 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 3D system level design exploration with a rough estimation of the performance, power and cost parameters. The designer will be able to focus on the 2D design issues while manually considering the 3D specificities.
\item RTL (Register Transfer Level) elaboration, which links the system level to the physical design by producing RTL models.
\item 3D physical design prototyping, which allows fast exploration of the physical design impact of alternative design/technology options on the performance, power and cost parameters.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Observation}
This work is also among the most integrated study in the literature. However, the criteria optimization is done following a uni-criterion approach which does not allow to explore quickly several possibilities.

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we have presented a short overview of the evolution of IC design. Manufacturers have pushed back the limitations of the silicon for the past decades and are now facing new challenges due mainly to quantum effects. 3D-SICs have been proposed to face these problems and we have shown a quick review of this promising technology.

With the 3D integration, design flows have evolved and integrate 3D partitioning and 3D place and route. However, these two steps are performed separately while they should be considered simultaneously as the circuits' performances will depend on the position of a component on a layer and the layer where it lies.

We have then presented researches that aim to deal with these challenges by making use of multi-objective optimization. To the best of our knowledge, all these tools use a uni-criterion approach or deal with a limited set of criteria while performing only trade-off analyses. This therefore lacks a more global view on all the criteria simultaneously and interesting information about a design space could be missed. The goal of this research is to show that a more multi-objective-oriented optimization could be more suitable to take into account the many aspects of a design.

To achieve this, we will present in the next chapter the tools related to the multi-criteria field. We will then detail how a 3D-SIC can be modelled to apply multi-objective optimization and show that a more multi-criteria is able to provide qualitative and quantitative information that would not be available with current tools.

%In the next chapter, we will describe a short overview of the tools coming from the operations research that will allow to take into account multiple criteria simultaneously.
