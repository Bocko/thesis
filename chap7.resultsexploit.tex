\section{Introduction}
In Chapter \ref{cha:model} we have shown how a 3D-SIC can be modelled and the problem we are dealing with in this work, as well as results based on multi-objective optimization. In Chapter \ref{cha:robustness}, we have shown that the methodology can show good convergence and diversity properties even if the problem contains criteria of heterogeneous nature. In this Chapter, we will discuss about how a designer could use these results and take advantage of a multi-criteria oriented methodology in the process of producing a 3D-SIC.
